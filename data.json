There's a good amount of longer period SSW swell in the water this afternoon, providing inconsistent waist-chest-shoulder high surf to a lot of spots when they show while standouts around the HB Pier and down into West Newport go head-high on occasion. The high tide warble, mostly walled lines, and onshore W wind bump aren't helping the cause any but the spots with some structure have a few rideable waves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nSimilar size sticks around through the end of the day, with persistent onshore flow keeping quality down this afternoon. Onshore wind comes down a couple of knots heading into the evening but that won't really do much to clean up the surf, expect conditions to be pretty rough through sundown.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://a.sprig.com/ZWZldWFCMFZRen5zaWQ6MWI5ZjlmYTMtOWQwMi00NTljLWFlZTctNzJkYzE2MTQzZjM1\">Was this report helpful?</a></p>", "expired": false}, "live": {"wind": {"direction": 302, "speed": 3.47591, "gust": 6.30008, "directionType": "Cross-shore"}}, "permissions": {"data": [], "violations": [{"code": 4001, "message": "User does not have optional permission:sl_premium-forecasts", "permission": {"name": "sl_premium-forecasts", "required": false}}, {"code": 4001, "message": "User does not have optional permission:sl_premium-cams", "permission": {"name": "sl_premium-cams", "required": false}}]}}
